This is the installation instructions of spaction.
Requirements:
  - A C++11 compiler (such as GCC 4.9 or higher, Clang 3.5 or higher)
  - SPOT 1.99.1 (incompatible with older versions)
  - Divine (runtime requirement, not necessary to compile spaction)
    Spot 1.99.1 also supports Promela models compiled by Spin, which should be easier to install than Divine, but has not been tested with spaction yet.

If you build spaction after cloning the git repository, you additionally require:
  - automake (1.14 or higher, untested with previous versions)
  - autoconf (2.69 or higher, untested with previous versions)


NOTE ON GCC 4.8

Despite claimed complete support for C++11, GCC 4.8 is not able to compile spaction, due to incomplete support for C++11 features in the libstdc++.

GCC 4.9 works fine (tested GCC 4.9.3).
GCC 5.1 works fine.


INSTALLING SPOT

Spaction currently requires Spot 1.99.1 (older versions are incompatible, more recent versions are untested).
You can retrieve Spot at this address: http://www.lrde.epita.fr/dload/spot/spot-1.99.1.tar.gz
Untar the archive, then in the spot directory run:
  ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/spot/to
  make
  make install

Please refer to the documentation of Spot for finer options.


INSTALLING DIVINE

On MAC OS (10.9), getting Divine to compile is a bit cumbersome.
The method described below should work.
It uses a patched version by LTSmin team.
It requires gcc 4.8 (tested with 4.8.2 installed through macport).
No other version of gcc was tried, but clang (built-in Apple version of 10.9) was and it miserably failed.

  git clone http://fmt.cs.utwente.nl/tools/scm/divine2.git
  cd divine2
  mkdir _build && cd _build
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER={absolute path to g++4.8} -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER={absolute path to gcc4.8} -DGUI=OFF -DRX_PATH= -DMURPHI=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX={prefix to install, should be in path when running spaction} -DHOARD=OFF 
  make
  make install

The executable should then be in the path when running spaction.
Depending on the used prefix, you may have to 
  export PATH=/divine/installation/path:$PATH


INSTALLING SPACTION

If you got spaction by cloning the git repository, first run autoconf:
  autoreconf -vfi

Then, or if you got spaction as a tarball, in the spaction directory run:
  ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/spaction/to
  make
  make install

If you installed spot in a non-standard directory, you can indicate SPOT path:
  ./configure --with-spot=/path/to/spot --prefix=/path/to/install/spaction/to

To get debug symbols and deactivate compiler optimizations, use the flag --enable-debug when running configure.
